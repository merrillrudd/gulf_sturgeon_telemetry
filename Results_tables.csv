Natal river-specific survival rates and detection probabilities using the river-specific spatial collapse method and natal geographic area survival rates and state-specific detection probabilities using the geographic area spatial collapse method. Italics means that there were not enough transmitters to decifer between survival and detection probability.,,,,,,,,,,"Table 3. Transition probabilities of Gulf sturgeon movement between rivers. Rows indicate natal river and columns denote destination. Shaded cells indicate fidelity rates, and cells grouped in boxes represent geographic groupings based on genetic analysis. ",,,,,,,,,
